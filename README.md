# PubNub Mobile Push Notification Demo for Android
> Application to show how to receive a PubNub message as a FCM (Firebase Cloud Message) on Android that has been sent over the PubNub network.

Despite the advantages of in-app messaging, there are cases where you may want to deliver messages via Mobile Push Notifications. PubNub's Mobile Push Gateway provides a method to deliver messages fast and reliably regardless of whether the application is in the foreground or background on iOS and Android devices.

PubNub's Mobile Push Notifications feature bridges native PubNub publishing with third-party push notification services including Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). The push gateway is a great way to make sure that you can send important data and messages out to users even when they're not active in your mobile application.
